# Email-Classifier-CNN
This project is an end-to-end deep learning application designed to automate the detection of spam emails using a highly efficient 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). By leveraging the power of TensorFlow and Keras, the system processes raw email text through a sophisticated NLP pipeline—involving tokenization, word embeddings,.
